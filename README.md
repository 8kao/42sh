# 42sh - Epitech Project

**A minimalist yet powerful Unix shell written in C.**  
This project is part of the Epitech curriculum and aims to recreate a fully functional command-line shell environment.

## Overview

`42sh` is a custom Unix shell that replicates key functionalities of standard shells like `bash` or `zsh`, with internal command handling and external binary execution.  
It supports built-in commands, pipelines, redirections, separators, environment management, and more.
